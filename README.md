# blah

This is the (ancient) code base that has been powering [planetcrap.com](http://www.planetcrap.com) since the year 2000 or so.

It's old. It's horrible. It's PHP. Don't use it. I'm merely providing it here so the PlanetCrap community can hack it and submit pull requests.

Do with this what you want (see the LICENSE file for details), but please don't ask me for support or to add new features, as I've been gone from all things PHP for _quite_ some time to focus on other things (first and foremost [Ruby and Ruby on Rails training and consulting](http://www.mans.de).)
