My bible.


Fixes:

- check type of uploaded avatar image
- check size of uploaded avatar image (set max_size in form!)
- allow uploading of GIFs

Other stuff:

- "bookmark" comments <http://www.planetcrap.com/blah.php?action=viewthread&thread_id=382&offset=0&limit=50#3>
- vote only when viewing full topic
- large avatars
- rewrite onProfileStore so it first creates a big "master" BMP
- lastread tracking for guests
- when starting to read a thread, put $offset and $limit into the URL right away (and pass it along, too!)
- "read more" link in topic.php light mode
- number in brackets after "submission bin" should display the number of un-voted for topics
- "please email me my login data"  (by entering email address)
- improve menu?
- make "new" icons for threads clickable, too
- change "new" comment links so they jump to a "page" with the first new comment "anchored", not just offset to first new comment.
- start/end of discussion links (page jumps)
- icons next to comments (indicating new vs. old)
- move quote strings into config define
- add default values for all or most defines
- avatar images (configurable)
- user option: show/hide avatar images
- onSignup(): check email for format and "evil" free email providers
- move activation key email body into some kind of template
- onUpdate: reads version table, updates tables accordingly
- move all strings out into language file
- comment attachments/images
- expire unverified accounts after 24 hours
- onStoreProfile(): arrayForceKeys on $extra (with user-definable key array)
- setting everything read on signup: this needs to be done differently, for example through a "global" lastread datetime stored with the user data. then my functions just need to check if the last comment datetime is higher than the global lastread; if yes, it THEN checks if a "local" lastread exists.
- config option of comment body & signature should be pre-rendered (more disk space usage)
- only purge stale users and online entries every couple of page loads (random)
- user setting: always preview
- user setting: launch links in new window?
- let old pc5 topics parse HTML
- option in comment form: include signature? (logged in users only)
- replace all references to $_SESSION with $this->session
- cache data in a member var, not a global
- check if votes are deleted when topic is published
- only allow uploading of avatars when user has > x points (configurable)
- avatar images on user online list

ideas:
- rate published topics (0-10)
